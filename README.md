# iCane
Crossing a road is a very easy task for most of us, but it is much harder for a visually challenged person. Our solution helps a blind person safely cross a road. Blind people are trained to walk with a cane, so we thought of an intelligent cane that works with an existing traffic system. Our criteria was based on observing videos of blind people crossing the road with a cane. First, the cane will control the traffic light. Second, the cane vibrates when it detects the black and white or yellow colors of a zebra crossing.


We researched how Arduino works with sensors and other components, and how to program for Arduino. Our
parts list consisted of Arduino UNO Modules, Ultrasonic sensor for detection of movement, LED Lights, LED
Matrix, and an IR Remote for the traffic signal, Line follower to detect color, and motor for vibration of the iCane.
We also built a road with poster paper for zebra and regular crossing.
In our first set of tests of the iCane vibration, we adjusted the line follower settings in order to detect white color. To
make the iCane portable, we mounted the motor on a portable selfie stick. We noticed that the color sensor
needed protection from breakage caused by striking the ground, so we mounted the color sensor on a round plate
with brackets to protect it from touching the ground. We also had to make sure that the fan blade does not touch
the selfie stick, which would prevent the cane from vibrating.
In our second set of tests, we interacted with the traffic light with we had to adjust the ultrasonic sensor so that it
beeps only when someone is close to it. We also had to adjust the program to make sure that the blind man can
only control the light when the ultrasonic sensor is turned on.

Our final prototype was 100% successful and we have accomplished the following: When a person is two feet from
the crossing, traffic signal beeps, The iCane can control the traffic light using the IR remote, and The iCane
vibrates on the crosswalk at 3 cm.


Blind people will safely cross the road using this device. There may be problems when road color varies from gray
to black. So, if this product was in circulation, the city must to paint all crosswalks black and white. A next step to
improve this prototype is to experiment with multiple sensors on black and gray roads to design the most accurate
equipment and methods.
