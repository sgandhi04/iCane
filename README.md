# iCane
Crossing a road is a very easy task for most of us, but it is much harder for a visually challenged person. Our solution helps a blind person safely cross a road. Blind people are trained to walk with a cane, so we thought of an intelligent cane that works with an existing traffic system. Our criteria was based on observing videos of blind people crossing the road with a cane. First, the cane will control the traffic light. Second, the cane vibrates when it detects the black and white or yellow colors of a zebra crossing.
